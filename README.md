# **Simple E-commerce Platform**

A simple yet scalable e-commerce web application built with **Django**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Currently being modernized into a **full-stack e-commerce application** with:  
- **Django** serving as the backend API using **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.  
- **React Native** for a sleek, responsive, and mobile-first frontend experience.

## **Features**

- User authentication and management
- Product catalog with categories
- Shopping cart and checkout functionality
- PostgreSQL database integration
- RESTful APIs (in progress) for seamless integration with modern frontend frameworks
- Mobile-friendly UI (planned with React Native)

---

## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### **1. Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js and npm (for future React Native integration)

### **2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

### **3. Set Up the Backend**

1. **Install Python virtual environment tools:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-venv python-is-python3
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install project dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure your PostgreSQL database:**
   - Create a database for the project.
   - Update the `DATABASES` setting in `settings.py` with your database credentials.

5. **Run database migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Your backend is now up and running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
